<p>I'm sorry if you had problems loading this site yesterday. The whole of my host's domain was out for hours. It turns out that they had a small fire in their server room, and had to evacuate the place and then get everything back up again. There doesn't seem to have been any harm done anyway. I think everything is still here, but if you emailed me yesterday, it may have got lost in the system.</p>
