Coffee is an amazing drink, isn't it? I can think of few other drinks that can
take on such a spectacular range of flavours and change so dramatically in
character with tiny changes in preparation method. And that's before you
think about changing the way in which the beans are roasted.

I have been steadily learning how to get good espresso from 
[my Rancilio Silvia][1], but while the coffee has become much more consistent
and pretty good, I knew it could be better. The fruity, acidic, winey flavours of
the beans were too dominating, so that the coffee tasted a bit unbalanced. It
wasn't unpleasant at all, but I personally like the more earthy, chocolate,
caramel and spicy kinds of flavours to be a bit more prominent. I had got to
the point where I could produce the same quality of coffee pretty consistently,
which when you consider all the variables involved (grind, dose, distribution of grounds
in the basket, tamping pressure, water temperature, extraction time and so on),
is something I view as quite an achievement in itself. How could I get more of
the rich and sweet flavours in the coffee?

After reading what felt like every article ever written on the
internet about coffee[^1], I stumbled on a suggestion that higher
brewing temperatures can bring out the 'darker' flavours, while lower
temperatures emphasise the more delicate, fruity ones. I had to
try it out. Keeping all the other variables as constant as I possibly
could, I changed the set point of my PID to 5&deg;C higher than its
previous setting. I did this in the evening before going to bed, so that
I wouldn't forget to make the change in the morning. It's an indication
of how sadly nerdy, I mean, _deeply fascinated_ I have become with the
whole process that I fell asleep thinking about what the coffee was
going to be like, and bounded downstairs the next day
like a child on Christmas morning.

Well. It was like night and day. I could tell it was going to be good
from the way it was rolling languidly from the spouts of the portafilter
and by the heavenly smell, but the first sip confirmed it. It was rich
and spicy with lovely bitter chocolate notes, but that was balanced by
the fruity tang I had before. It was even a different texture, with
much more body and viscosity. All that transformation from a change of
5&deg;C. This morning I even managed to produce the kind of _crema_ on
the top that you see in all the coffee pr0n photos and videos: a deep,
caramel or hazelnut coloured gloopy liquid, spotted with paler colours.
I was so excited that I yelled at Mr. Bsag, "COME AND LOOK AT MY CREMA!
LOOK AT IT!". He humoured me with a 'yes it's a lovely crema darling' look,
but I could tell that he just wanted to drink some coffee. He does agree
that it's dramatically better than before though, so I know that it's
not just my wishful thinking.

Next, I will conquer microfoam!

Oh dear. I think I may be hooked. On the positive side, it does make getting up
at a stupidly early hour much more interesting.
