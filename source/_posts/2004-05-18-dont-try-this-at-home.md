<p>Note to self: when you have just moved in to a new office, and haven't quite got used to the layout of the furniture, <strong>do not</strong> place your bag directly under low shelves which hang on the wall. Rummaging in the bag and sitting up suddenly can only end in the untimely death of several billion much-needed brain cells, and a lot of un-ladylike swearing.</p>
