<p>I've just realised that this blog is one year old today! I can hardly believe that I've been writing it for a whole year--it certainly doesn't seem like that long. It's hard to imagine life without writing something every day--well, almost every day. I've got so much more out of it than I could ever have imagined this time last year.</p>
