<p>I've knocked up a rather primitive checkbox type thing so that you can switch the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000525.html">fancy titles</a> effect on or off. Check the box on the right to toggle the effect, and then reload the page. The current status is shown beneath the checkbox. The script saves the state you've selected in a cookie, so you obviously need to allow cookies to be set for this to work.</p>

<p>It's horribly inelegant at the moment (for one thing, it doesn't remember the checked state of the checkbox), so I'll develop something better when I have time.</p>
