<p>I went to buy a birthday card for my cousin's one year old daughter at lunchtime today. There were a few cheery looking cards, but a particularly bright design with a "1 Today!" banner along the bottom caught my eye. It had a little board picture book inserted into the top of the card, and I thought it would be a lot more exciting for her than just a card. Then I looked on the back and saw a little sticker which read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not suitable for children under 36 months</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really.</p>
