<p>For the first time this year, cycling back home yesterday, I smelt the summer smell. That indefinable scent of grass and nectar and warm air that means that summer has arrived at last. Of course, since this is Britain, this means that we have perhaps two or three days of summer weather to enjoy before the drizzle sets in again.</p>
