<p>I saw a van belonging to a local bathroom fitting company today -- a company which has the word <em>Classique</em> in its name. Now, what does that word bring to your mind when applied to bathroom fittings? What logo would would say <em>Classique</em> to you?</p>

<ul>
<li>Luxurious Roman baths, decked out with fine mosaics?</li>
<li>Basins with Doric columns supporting them?</li>
<li>A Victorian claw-foot bath?</li>
<li>Something redolent of ancient Greek temples?</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidently, that wasn't what the graphic designer had in mind. The van featured a large logo depicting a stick man sitting on the toilet, reading a newspaper. Classy.</p>
