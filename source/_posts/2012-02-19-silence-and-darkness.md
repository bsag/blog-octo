A couple of days ago, I came across [this review][] of Brian Eno's 'Music for
Airports'. It's an album I like very much, and have found very calming at
various points in my life. One particular description struck me as being
perceptive:

This is music, not just sound. There's structure there, melody. But it's
also something of a hologram. There's a three dimensionality about this
piece. Listen, and you can walk around in the music. Listen, and you can
imagine and see space, the architecture around you. Listen, and become
completely centered and aware of yourself.

{% endblockquote %}

He also mentions in the review that the original vinyl album (which I also
have) has 30 seconds of silence at the end of each piece. This is an important
part of the work, and one that you should listen carefully to.

I've been thinking a lot about silence recently. Most of us live in a noisy
world. In cities, silence is an exceedingly rare and treasured quality, because
there is always some background (or foreground) noise: traffic, music, alarms,
aeroplanes, sirens, ringing mobiles, and raised voices. I also seem to be
getting what I think is probably mild [tinnitus][], so it's hard for me to find
silence even in a quiet environment. But true, *enjoyable* silence isn't the
complete absence of sound, but deep quietness in which you can feel the space
around you.

One of my [favourite activities][] on trips to Brazil was to go out on the river in
the dark. On recent trips, we have got up well before dawn to go out in the
boat, looking for jaguars. We never actually saw one, but for me, that was only
a small part of the experience anyway. The quality of silence on these trips
was beautiful. As we set off into the darkness, the roar of the outboard motor
and the slap of the water on the hull overwhelmed everything. Eventually we
reached a particularly good spot (or so the guide said) for spotting jaguars,
and he would cut the engine for us to listen for their calls.

The river at this point was extremely wide, with low trees and shrubs on the
bank. There is little light pollution at night in the Pantanal, so the stars are
overwhelming, and the great bow of the Milky Way was above and below us,
reflected in the still water of the river. It was disorienting: I began to
think that I was looking at the sky, until a gentle breeze caused the stars to
shiver. Sitting in the dark in a boat in the middle of the river felt like
floating on a plane between two gigantic dark mirrored bowls.

The silence on the water was incredibly rich. I don't think I've ever
experienced anything like it before. There was no noise of human
activity at all, so the background silence was a deep, velvety black.
However, we could hear sounds of other life. On the banks, herons
and egrets were beginning to rouse in their roosts, grumbling and
squabbling in their harsh, croaking voices. Around the boat we could
hear the watery popping of fish surfacing or caiman submerging to the
depths. Bats returning to their roosts after a night of hunting gently
flicked the air, soft as a moth's wing. All of these sounds served to
intensify the silence, giving it space and texture, in the same way that
shining a torch beam into the night thickens the darkness around the
light. It wasn't oppressive. On the contrary, it was an extraordinary,
contradictory experience. I felt excited but serene, aware of the space
around me but also taken out of myself.

We made a few of those trips over the years, and I always cherished the
experience, and felt rather bereft when the guide started the engine again to
take us back. I would love a bit of that silence and darkness right now.
