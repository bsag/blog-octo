<p>...or in my case, shuffle forward. I hate the day that the clocks go forwards &mdash; I feel cheated out of an hour of sleep, even if I go to bed an hour <em>early</em> the night before, and I feel out of sorts all day. It didn't help that I had a project to finish (for some value of 'finish') and consequently had a lot to get done today.</p>

<p>I much prefer Autumn, with the clocks going backwards. Still, you can't do that at both ends of the year &mdash; it just wouldn't work, would it? I'm too tired to think about it.</p>
