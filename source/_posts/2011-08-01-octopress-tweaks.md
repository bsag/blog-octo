After getting some feedback about the new design (the consensus seemed to be that the fonts were TOO BIG), I've tweaked the design and structure slightly. I've added back the link under each post's title that shows how many comments there are, and which links to the comment thread itself on the individual article page. Previously it wasn't as clear as it might have been that there was any way to comment, unless you visited the individual article page. If anything else is still a bit wonky, let me know and I'll see if I can fix it.

By the way, [Joyent][], the company which hosts this blog, has just let me know that there will be some maintenance on my shared server tomorrow, so the site might be down for about 45 minutes at some point during the day. So if it's down for a bit tomorrow, it's not my fault!
