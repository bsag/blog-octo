If you use Octopress and the excellent [URI.LV][1] service (as I do) to manage and track your feeds, and you have a Premium account, you might be interested to know that you can use the new API to notify URI.LV immediately when you have updated your content. I have posted instructions on how to do this as a [Gist][2].

Enjoy!
