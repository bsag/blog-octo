<p>For those of you following the development of my GTD web application, <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/">Tracks</a>, I've written a long and rambling article (I'm really selling this, aren't I?) about features I'm thinking about including in the next major version <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/article/13/the-road-to-tracks-11">here</a>.</p>
