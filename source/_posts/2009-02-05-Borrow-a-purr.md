<p>If you don't have a cat, but enjoy the sound of purring, you are welcome to borrow <a href="http://bsag.tumblr.com/post/75919685/cleo-purring-the-sound-i-love-hearing-at-the-end">30 seconds of Cleo's purring</a>, recorded earlier this evening.</p>

<p>You'll need to turn the volume up a bit, because the mic on the iPhone isn't very sensitive. In case you are wondering, the funny squeaky sound at the start is her sniffing the iPhone.</p>
