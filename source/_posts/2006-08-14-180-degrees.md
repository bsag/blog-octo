<p>Our new house is on the same train line that I used to commute to work on, but on the other side of the University. This means that I arrive at (and leave) the University on the opposite platform to the one I'm used to. It's going to feel quite weird until I'm used to it, and lends a kind of 'Alice Through The Looking-Glass' feel to my mornings, particularly when I'm not quite awake. Human auto-pilot is a surprisingly powerful thing.</p>
