Sometimes you can't help but be amazed by the awesome superpowers possessed by
cats. Let's take their uncanny ability to detect the maximally inconvenient
location in which to place themselves, shall we? Mr. Bsag tends to come to bed
a little later than me, since I'm a lark and he's an owl, so while I get ready
for bed, I usually have the bedroom to myself. Well, not quite to myself,
because the cats tend to join me, particularly Bella. What usually happens is
that I turn a corner of the duvet back on my side of the bed (ready for me to
get into bed), then turn away from the bed to hang a few clothes in the
wardrobe. Inevitably, what I'm greeted with when I turn back to the bed
moments later is Bella, sitting with her paws tucked comfortably underneath
her, squarely and neatly in the middle of the turned-over corner of duvet.

This, I am fairly sure, is mathematically the Location of Maximum
Inconvenience (or, LMI) on the bed. Imagine the surface of the bed as a 2D contour
plot, shaded using a kind of heatmap indicating how inconvenient it would be
(for the human occupant, i.e. me) to have a cat placed at that location. Less
inconvenient areas would be shaded a cool blue (such as the entire side of the
bed that belongs to Mr. Bsag), while the Inconvenience Hotspots would be
bright red. The hottest and reddest spot would be that little triangle of
folded over duvet, and Bella homes in on it like an inconvenience-seeking
missile.

I think she likes this spot so much because not only is it maximally
inconvenient for me, but also maximally comfortable for her, because it
consists of not one but two thicknesses of lovely squashy duvet. When I turn
back from the wardrobe and see her there, and address her with a weary,
"Bella!", she looks at me with her most innocent "What?" expression, and a
kind of limpet-like tenacity that Occupy Movement protestors could learn
a great deal from. In my more charitable moments, I try to see this daily
battle of wills in a more positive light. Some fancy hotels leave a little
chocolate on your pillow when they make the room up, I have a cat adorning the
corner of my duvet.
