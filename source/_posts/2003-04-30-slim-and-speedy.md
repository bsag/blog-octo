<p>Phew! Those crazy guys at <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/">Slimdevices</a> must never sleep: no sooner had <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/apple-music-stuff/" title="Apple music stuff">Apple released iTunes 4</a>, than they had released a new version of the <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/su_downloads.html" title="SliMP3 Server 4.1b1">SliMP3 server</a> software supporting the new version &mdash; barely 24 hours later! There's no support for AAC as yet, but they do say in the <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/su_faq.html#formats-aac">FAQ</a> that they are looking into it, which is encouraging.</p>
