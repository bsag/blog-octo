<p>I've finally got round to posting some more pictures to my <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/wingsopenwide/index.php" title="wings open wide">photoblog</a> &mdash; the thumbnails aren't very interesting, but I'm quite pleased with the full-sized results, despite the annoying jagged edges on the diagonal lines. I think these are the result of compression, but if anyone has any suggestions for avoiding them in future, I'd be grateful.</p>
