<p>I'm bunking off work tomorrow to go to the <a href="http://www.mac-expo.co.uk/">MacExpo</a> in London. I'll probably be back late, but I'm hoping to get time for a full report on Saturday. If you're visiting the Expo and spot a short woman having a Gollum-like argument with herself about the merits and demerits of blowing six months of salary on a <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">G5</a>, then do come and say hello. And stop me, please...</p>
