On Monday, I watched a really wonderful documentary: [The Real Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines][1]. There's still time to watch it on
iPlayer, and I heartily recommend doing so, even if you have no interest in
microlights. It was the kind of documentary I love, in which you let people
with a passion for something tell their own story.

In this case, the cameras followed several participants in the 'Round Britain
Rally', a gloriously Wacky Races event, in which the aim is to rack up the most points
over three days by flying over designated waypoints dotted around the UK in a
microlight aircraft. Some of the microlights looked quite fancy with semi-rigid
wings and enclosed cabins, but all of the aircraft piloted by the three teams
mentioned were rather more basic in design. Indeed, the vintage model flown by
Antony Woodward and his team-mate appeared to feature rather alarming quantities
of gaffer tape and string. Antony described a microlight as "essentially a
chainsaw attached to a deckchair". Or in their case, a chainsaw attached to a
deckchair with string.

Anthony had suffered a dreadful crash in a microlight some years before while
participating in the same race when his machine hit a powerline. I can't help
thinking that he was a bit crazy to want to get back into a microlight and
compete in the same rally, but that's what he did. Anthony and his team mate
(whose name I can't remember) were simultaneously hilarious and terrifying.
Anthony cheerfully admitted that he has absolutely no aptitude for flying, and
demonstrated that rather ably with a series of 'interesting' landings and
haphazard map-reading skills, much to his team mate's fury. In the end, they decided
not to take the competitive aspects so seriously, and had a wonderful time.
Antony even managed a good landing to end the race.

Paul flew his microlight with his teenage son Mikey from their home in
Ireland across the Irish Sea to the start point. Mikey was determined to
go with his Dad, but was visibly (and quite understandably) terrified
by the prospect. Their relationship and the way they bonded during the
rally was such a touching thing. Paul tried to take Mikey's mind off
the possibility of plunging to a fiery death by singing some rather
excellent bawdy songs at top volume or playing 'I Spy', and Mikey was
determined not to let his Dad down.

The final competitor was Richard Meredith-Hardy, for whom the rally must
have seemed like a stroll in the park. He has flown a microlight from
London to Sydney, and even flown over Mount Everest. Richard
is brilliant. He's a quiet, smiling man with an extraordinary pair of
eyebrows, who does absolutely insane things in a microlight. At one
point, he demonstrated his mid-air refuelling technique. When Air Force
pilots do this kind of thing, they have millions of pounds worth of
military hardware to help them. Richard had a few jerry cans full of
fuel where his co-pilot would have been, and a bit of tubing. In a scene
that I watched through my fingers, he undid his seatbelt so that he
could twist around and fiddle with the cans and tubing, all while trying
to hold the craft steady. Microlights &mdash; it hardly needs saying
&mdash; don't have autopilot, just a wibbly bar that you have to try to
keep steady while the open cockpit in which you sit hangs and sways from
the wings. Terrifying.

The views from the microlights were stunning but the pilots seemed so
vulnerable. I can see the appeal, though &mdash; you really experience flying
in a way that's just not possible in any other kind of powered aircraft, but
I don't think I'm brave enough to actually try it.
