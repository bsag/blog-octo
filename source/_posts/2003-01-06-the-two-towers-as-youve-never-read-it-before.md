<p><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=lemonlye&itemid=19097" title="A brilliant parody of The Two Towers">Lemonlye</a> has written a brilliantly funny (and affectionate) parody of The Two Towers. The three-way telepathy call is particularly hilarious. It's just the kind of thing I would have written if I was witty and intelligent.</p>
