<p>I dealt with my first comment spam with <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">MT-Blacklist</a> today! It didn't get caught by the default filter, but with a quick click on the blacklist link in the notification email, I added the offending URL to the list, and <em>poof</em>--the spam comment was magically removed. No tedious deleting of the comment, adding the IP and waiting for the site to rebuild.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to look at the blacklist of the banned URLs and regexes for the URLs, you can find it <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blacklist.txt">here</a>.</p>
