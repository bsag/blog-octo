Sunday trading hours are in the news at the moment, as the government is planning to [suspend current Sunday trading restrictions][1] for the duration of the Olympics this summer. 'Small' shops are currently already exempt from such laws, but what many people do not perhaps appreciate is how disruptive apparently 'small' shops can be.

But first, a bit of backstory. When we first moved into our house, there was
a pub just opposite it. At first, this wasn't much of a problem, but gradually
the customers got rougher and the landlord lost of control of the situation.
There were regular fights in the car park and up and down the road between
lagered-up lads, and the whole thing ended tragically in someone being killed.
The pub was closed pending the licence being re-issued under particular
conditions. In the end, it stayed closed for months and was eventually sold.
The building remained empty for quite some time until building work started
suddenly. We were surprised, because we hadn't heard about any planning
applications, but when we spoke to the workmen, it appeared that Tesco had
bought the building.

Planning regulations are labyrinthine, but it seems that if you buy a building,
work within its shell, and you do not alter the use of the building, you do not
need to seek planning permission. Changing from a pub to a small supermarket
does not apparently constitute change of use, and since Tesco just gutted the
interior of the pub but left the exterior largely unchanged, it could all go
ahead without any of the neighbours needing to be informed.

The supermarket has been open more than a year now. Since it counts as
a 'small' shop, it does not have restricted hours on a Sunday. In fact, it is
open 6am until 11pm every day of the week (we do get peace and quiet on
Christmas Day, though!), despite the fact that in a meeting before they opened,
representatives from Tesco said the hours would be 7am until 10pm. The problem
is, a small supermarket in a large chain is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Huge
articulated trucks deliver goods to the shop several times a day, literally
blotting out the light to our front room as they pass, and often having
difficulty getting in to the small loading bay at one side of the shop.
Newspapers get delivered (noisily, by *two* separate companies) at about 5am
before the shop is open, and customers wait with their engines running and
music blaring in the street (rather than the purpose-built car park) for their
buddies to come out with a pint of milk or a pack of cigarettes.

The thing is, we live in a normal, residential street, but the shop is serviced
and run like a huge hypermarket in an empty industrial estate. We had no say in
any of it. We have since tried to complain about various issues (like the
unnecessarily noisy newspaper deliveries), but trying to find the correct
person to complain to in a giant corporation like Tesco is and exercise in
frustration and futility. I have no love at all for Tesco, but in fairness they
are probably no worse than any of the other big supermarket chains. The problem
is that planners regard these small shops like a corner shop, but they are not.
The owner doesn't get his son to nip to the Cash &amp; Carry in the Rascal for
supplies[^1], with minimal disruption to anyone else &mdash; it's one node in
a country-wide supply chain for a gigantic corporation.

If the government goes ahead with its planned changes, people living close to
those shops will be inconvenienced for 8 weeks. Spare a thought for those of us
who have to live with these wolves in sheep's clothing all the time.
