<p>In common with many large institutions, the University tends to turn off the central heating system in its buildings on a given date each year, rather than in response to the weather warming. Inevitably---as this year---this coincides with a cold snap, so that everyone spends a couple of weeks shivering in their suddenly-cold offices.</p>

<p>Note to self: wear a warm jumper tomorrow.</p>
