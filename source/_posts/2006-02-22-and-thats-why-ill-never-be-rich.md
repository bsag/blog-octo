<p>Sometimes I could really curse my natural, idiotic honesty. Today I bought a cup of coffee in a coffee shop and handed over a &pound;5 note in payment. However, the barrista behind the counter gave me change for a &pound;10 note. Before I could stop myself, I'd blurted out, "But I gave you five pounds---you've given me change for ten."</p>

<p>D'oh! Damn you, stupid Honest Brain---why can't you just keep your do-gooding trap shut? We could have been a fiver up.</p>
