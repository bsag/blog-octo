<p>Everyone's gone <a href="http://www.antipixel.com/blog/archives/2003/05/22/those_bloody_buttons.html#comments" title="Antipixel--where it all started">button mad</a>! You can <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/25906" title="Metafilter">make your own</a> or steal them from <a href="http://gtmcknight.com/buttons.html" title="gtmcknight.com--steal these buttons">gtmcknight.com</a> &mdash; which is what I did! I had a few buttons before, but I thought that I'd take the opportunity to update them and replace a few with prettier ones. I know that that everyone and his dog uses them, but they are a nice compact way to display information.</p>
