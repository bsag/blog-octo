<p>I found <a href="http://www.bob-and-jenna.org/bobblog/archives/000201.html" title="bobblog">this</a> great (and funny) phrasing of a moral dilemma today (via <a href="http://greynotebook.typepad.com/grey/" title=""08 - The Grey Notebook"">jb's</a> blog). After I'd read it (and laughed my head off), I remembered that I'd seen something similar ages ago, but I <em>still</em> got suckered in.</p>
