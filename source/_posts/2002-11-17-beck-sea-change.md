<p>I was really surprised by this one. My brother recommended it to me, but never having liked Beck much before, I wasn't at all sure that I would like it. I couldn't have been more wrong. It's a trippy, mellow album, with bitter-sweet lyrics and is surprisingly tuneful. There are also some very nice string arrangements which add some depth and complexity.</p>
