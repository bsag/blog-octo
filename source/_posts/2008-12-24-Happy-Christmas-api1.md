<p>I probably won't be posting for a little while. I've got various family visits to make, and I've got to move all my various web sites to a new server. The latter will be lovely when it's done, but is currently causing me some headaches. At some point during the move, I'll put a temporary message up on this site while I'm shifting the virtual furniture around, but you should be directed to the new site automatically when it's all done.</p>

<p>Have a very peaceful and relaxing Christmas, everyone!</p>
