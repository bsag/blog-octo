<p>If you fancy a bit of a laugh, take a look at <a href="http://franklarosa.com/vinyl/" title="Wacky vinyl">this site</a>. There's all manner of bizarre and unusual recordings -- Muhammad Ali singing about tooth decay, anyone? My favourite is <a href="http://franklarosa.com/vinyl/Exhibit.jsp?AlbumID=67" title="Beatle Barkers">"Beatle Barkers"</a>. Give "Love Me Do" a listen, and marvel at the close harmony sheep on backing vocals. [via <a href="http://boingboing.net/" title="BoingBoing">BoingBoing]</a> </p>
