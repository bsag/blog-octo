I'm just in the process of upgrading to Wordpress 1.5, and some things are temporarily broken. Bear with me while I fix stuff up. If you saw brief flashes of either nothing at all, 500 errors, or completely different stylesheets, that was me frantically trying to sort things out. <img src="http://www.rousette.org.uk/images/smileys/grin.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="grin" style="border:0;" />
