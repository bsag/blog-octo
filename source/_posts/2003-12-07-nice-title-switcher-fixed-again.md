<p>I'm sorry about all the messing about, but I've finally managed to improve the switcher without breaking anything[1]. I've also rolled it out to all of the main pages, so nice titles should work everywhere (or not work everywhere if you've got it switched off). I'll stop messing about now...</p>

<p>[1] Yesterday I left out a set of parentheses in the JavaScript, which was what caused all the problems. D'oh!</p>
