<p>I've just put up some more Lomo photos at <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/wingsopenwide/archives/cat_lomo.html">wings open wide</a>. Most were taken in the Covered Market &mdash; a wonderful bastion of small independent traders who manage to hold out against the tide of Starbucks and McDonalds outlets.</p>

<p>The light levels are rather low in the market, and there are lots of colourful displays, so the Lomo is the perfect tool for taking shots. As usual, the results were wildly variable and  somewhat unexpected, but I was quite pleased with the way that some of them turned out &mdash; reflections figured prominently.</p>
