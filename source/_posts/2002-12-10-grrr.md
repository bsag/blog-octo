<p>I've just spent half an hour tinkering with my XML summaries, thinking that I'd broken something when I moved hosts. I'd got round to testing it with <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/" title="NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a>, but found that I got an error when I tried to subscribe. Minor panic ensued. I couldn't find anything wrong with the file, and after tearing my hair out in a techno-rage, I finally decided to try quitting and re-starting NetNewsWire. My XML file now loaded beautifully. Why, in the name of the God of Geeks, why?</p>
