<p>This fantastic <a href="http://virt.vgmix.com/v-starwars.mp3">a cappella rendering</a> of the Star Wars theme has just made my day. It's actually quite inventive, but it was the demented gerbil sound-a-like melody line that really did it for me. All I can say is that if you are feeling a bit tired, stressed and fed up with life in general, a couple of repeats of this track is equivalent to a whole course of Prozac. There aren't any side-effects either, other than the tune sticking with alarming tenacity to the inside of your brain.</p>
