<p>Three volumes of glorious song writing, containing almost every musical style known to man or woman, this album is the fruit of the genius Stephin Merritt. Few other musicians can make you laugh one minute and cry the next. The songs may all be about love (the bitter and the sweet of it), but they are never sentimental: </p>

<blockquote>
The book of love is long and boring
No one can lift the damn thing
It's full of charts and facts and figures
and instructions for dancing
</blockquote>

<p>or, </p>

<blockquote>
or I could make a career of being blue
I could dress in black and read Camus
smoke clove cigarettes and drink vermouth
like I was 17
that would be a scream
but I don't want to get over you
</blockquote>

<p>Fantastic stuff. The album has superb lyrics, great music (80's synth pop, punk, show tunes, crooner classics, country and western, it's all there) and is brilliantly entertaining.</p>
