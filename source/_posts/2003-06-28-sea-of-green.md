<p>The reeds and rushes in the water meadows are now almost as tall as I am. In the breeze, they ripple like a green sea, a froth of creamy meadowsweet flowers capping the waves. If I close my eyes, I can imagine myself on a quiet shore. As I walk the path through the meadow, I smile, feeling like Moses parting the waves.</p>

<p>Everything is lush.</p>
