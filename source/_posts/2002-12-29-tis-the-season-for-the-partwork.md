<p>Yes, it's that time of year again. The time to start collecting that new partwork on Understanding Your PC/Collecting Miniature Teapots/Worming Your Opossum. Who buys these things, and more importantly, why? You can buy a book with identical information in it, and pay about the same, so why wait every week for some pathetic little magazine thing? Do they need that sense of anticipation? Or can they only digest a certain number of words at a time before their brain becomes dangerously overloaded, and might explode? My theory is that the publishers rely on some kind of New Year related enthusiasm to start a hobby. I'm betting that 99.9% of people buy less than three parts and then lose interest in the nuggets of opossum worming wisdom. But there must be a few people who do, in fact, have a complete partwork set. I think they need help.</p>
