<p>Friday night is <a href="http://www.cocktail.com/recipes/w/WhiteRussian.htm">White Russian</a> night chez bsag. Yay! I can't recommend it highly enough. If you have a DVD of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9YmlnIGxpZWJvd3NraXxmdD0xfG14PTIwfGxtPTUwMHxjbz0xfGh0bWw9MXxubT0x;fc=1;ft=12;fm=1">The Big Liebowski</a> to hand, so much the better, but if not, you can just imagine that you're stoned and lying on your rug listening to a tape of bowling balls knocking down pins. Perhaps you are---I don't need to know what you do in the privacy of your own home.</p>
