<p>I've got back my first pictures taken with the Lomo. I'm really pleased with the way some of them came out -- particularly the ones taken at night. It really excels at rich, neon-like colours. I've got a much better idea now of what kinds of image work well and which don't. Anyway, I've put the results up on <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/wingsopenwide/archives/cat_lomo.html">wings open wide</a> so take a look and see what you think.</p>
